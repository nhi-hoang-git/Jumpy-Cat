Project of Nhi Hoang, Nataly Yau, Rose Joseph, Minh Nguyen

This project is a fun game inspired by the Chromes T-Rex game, but with silly cats!

You get to play as a cat instead of a dinosaur. A killer bread that is threatening your cat, so you need to jump over it without touching! Or else, the game is over. It is simple and easy to play for everyone!

How to Play?
1. Press spacebar to jump
2. Avoid the killer bread to continue playing
3. Try not to get distracted by the silly cats!

Languages:
HTML, CSS, Javascript

Challenges and solutions:
Bugs: There would be small bugs that would arise from our program while we were coding, and it would be a hinderance to our coding process. But, with the help of several eyes of our teammates and merging our debugging strategies together, we were able to resolve these bugs and fix our code.

Lack of JavaScript knowledge: Our team was unfamiliar with JavaScript, which was a pivotal file for our game in order to achieve the game's functionality. However, we utilized online resources and Hackathon workshops that helped us clear the air about JavaScript and learned more about the language.
